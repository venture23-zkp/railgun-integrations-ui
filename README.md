This is a [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-rainbowkit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/packages/create-rainbowkit).

## Having Troubles installing node_modules?
- Use npm instead of yarn
- In rare cases, you might be forced to install deps with node v14.x.x and run with v16.x.x
- You can try run the following commands before installing the deps.
```sh
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server and add missing environment variables:

```bash
# Fill in missing values
cp $(pwd)/env.sample $(pwd)/.env
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
